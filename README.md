## Getting Started
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running your project

This project includes a live-reloading static server on port `8080`, which will build, launch, and rebuild the app whenever you change application code. To start the server, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

If you prefer to just build without the live reload and build-on-each-change watcher, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
